# Dataset adapter

Dataset adapter is an adapter component in the VISDOM data management system. See [Components for the Data Management System](../../README.md) for upper level architecture on the data management system.

The dataset adapter can be used to fetch software data given in a general data model. This implementation is an extension to the [General data model adapter](../general/README.md). It adds support of raw data extracted from the dataset [The Technical Debt Dataset](https://github.com/clowee/The-Technical-Debt-Dataset) using [Dataset fetcher](../../../python/dataset-fetcher/README.md).

The dataset adapter can also be used with only support for the software project dataset.
